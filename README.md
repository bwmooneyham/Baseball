This repo contains the Python analysis files used in the making of my blog post: Swinging for the Fences! Using Machine Learning to Predict the Unpredictable in Baseball: Whoâ€™s Going to Make the Playoffs? (https://bwmooneyham.com/2016/09/23/baseball/ )


"Baseball_Forward_Final.py" - Utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling and Support Vector Machines to 1) identify prototypical "types" of baseball players (hitters and pitchers), 2) describe individual Major League Baseball teams in terms of their composition with regard to these "types" of players, and 3) predict which MLB teams made the playoffs based on their player compositions from the previous season.

"Baseball_Players_Final.py" - Identifies the most "prototypical" player for each of the "types" identified in the previous script. This script also assesses the distribution of player types among playoff teams.
